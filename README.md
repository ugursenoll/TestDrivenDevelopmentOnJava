# What is Test Driven Development (TDD)?

Test-driven development (TDD) is a process which combines test-first development where you write a test before you write just enough production code to fulfill that test and refactoring.

Rules
- Write only enough of a unit test to fail.
- Write only enough production code to make the failing unit test pass.

TDD is a way to make sure that what your code is doing what it should be doing.

# TDD Process

The process is often described as Red/Green/Refactor cycle
