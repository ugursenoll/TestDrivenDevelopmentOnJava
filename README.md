# What is Test Driven Development (TDD)?

Test-driven development (TDD) is a process which combines test-first development where you write a test before you write just enough production code to fulfill that test and refactoring.

Rules
- Write only enough of a unit test to fail.
- Write only enough production code to make the failing unit test pass.

TDD is a way to make sure that what your code is doing what it should be doing.

# TDD Process

The process is often described as Red/Green/Refactor cycle

- Red : Write a test for the expected behavior
- Green : Write the code for that test to pass
- Refactor : Cleanup your code (Remove code duplication etc)

This approach is guiding developer to define the problem first before going in to the solution.

In this project, I developed a movie store project in java using the tdd software development approach.
